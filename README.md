ApolloCrossDev is intended to help (future) Amiga/Apollo developers to setup Cross Compilers on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu x64 architecture only), offering a selection of the best toolchains which I  reverse engineered from the excellent work by some of the most skilled and dedicated Amiga developers in the past 20 years;

> GCC-2.95.3        : based on toolchain-m68k by Krystian BacÅ‚awski (cahirwpz)
> GCC-3.4.6         : based on NetSurf Toolchain by NetSurf Development Team
> GCC 6.5.0         : based on Amiga-GCC by Stefan Franke (Bebbo) - PREFERRED CHOICE (*)
> GCC 12.2          : based on vscode-amiga-debug from Abyss (Bartman)
> VBCC/VASM/VLINK   : based on Hasenbraten VBCC from Dr.Barthelmann & Frank Wille

(*) Apollo Development Team advises to work with the GCC 6.5.0 "Stable" Toolchain (see below).

Requirements:
1. Debian or Ubuntu x64 architecture installed in a Virtual Machine 
2. Microsoft Visual Studio Code downloaded and installed
3. Basic Git tools installed from CLI (sudo apt install git)
4. ApolloExplorer (https://github.com/ronybeck/ApolloExplorer)

Installation:
1. Open Microsoft Visual Studio Code
2. Clone ApolloCrossDev: Copy repository hyperlink | CTRL+Shift+P git clone | Paste repository hyperlink
3. Click "Open in New Window" | Click "Compilers" + "ApolloCrossDev.code-workspace" + "Open Workspace"
4. Open Terminal: Right-click "Compilers" | Select "Open in integrated Terminal"
5. Enter Compiler directory (example: "cd GCC-6.50-Stable") and start Install script (example: "./GCC-6.50-Stable.sh")

For further ApolloCrossDev installation help a video guide is available at: xxx

Test Compiler:
1. Right-click Projects/hello-amiga folder and choose "Open in Integrated Terminal"
2. Type 

Create Project:
1. Create Projects/<mysource> folder to include all your *.c and *.s sourcefiles (example: Projects/hello)
2. Copy makefile template from Project/_makefiles into your folder (example: Projects/hello/make-gcc650-stable)
3. Type "make -f make-xxxyyy" or read make file for further Compile instructions (example: make -f make-gcc650-stable)

GCC-6.50:
Apollo Team has chosen GCC 6.50 as preferred version for developing software for Apollo V4 Series.
GCC-6.50-Stable is the Apollo controlled version that is advised for your Cross Development Compiler.
GCC-6.50-Apollo-XXXX versions are all alpha/beta versions for testing new Apollo 68080 instructions.
GCC-6.50-Apollo-ALL1 is the alpha/beta version in which all new Apollo-XXXX instructions are included.
GCC-6.50-Latest is the latest version from Stefan -Bebbo- Franke repository, not under Apollo control.

NOTE: ApolloCrossDev GCC-6.50-Stable includes compiling SDL v1.2 and MUI 5.0 libraries
