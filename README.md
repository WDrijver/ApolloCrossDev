ApolloCrossDev is intended to help (future) Amiga/Apollo developers to setup Cross Compilers on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu 64-bits), offering a selection of the best toolchains which I  reverse engineered from the excellent work by some of the most skilled and dedicated Amiga developers in the past 20 years;

* GCC-2.95.3        : based on toolchain-m68k by Krystian Bac≈Çawski (cahirwpz)
* GCC-3.4.6         : based on NetSurf Toolchain by NetSurf Development Team
* GCC 6.5.0         : based on Amiga-GCC by Stefan Franke (Bebbo)
* GCC 12.2          : based on vscode-amiga-debug from Abyss (Bartman)
* VBCC/VASM/VLINK   : based on Hasenbraten VBCC from Dr.Barthelmann & Frank Wille

Requirements:
1. Debian of Ubuntu 64-bit Linux Virtual Machine
2. Microsoft Visual Studio Code
3. Basic Git tools (sudo apt-get install git)
4. ApolloExplorer (optional for easy file-transfer to Apollo devices)

Installation:
1. Open Microsoft Visual Studio Code
2. Clone ApolloCrossDev: Copy repository hyperlink | CTRL+Shift+P git clone | Paste repository hyperlink
3. Click "Open in New Window" | Click "Compilers" + "ApolloCrossDev.code-workspace" + "Open Workspace"
4. Open Terminal: Right-click "Compilers" | Select "Open in integrated Terminal"
5. Enter each Compiler directory (example: "cd GCC-2.95") and start Install script (example: "./GCC-2.95.sh")

Instructions:
1. Create Projects/mysource directory for your *.c and *.s sourcefiles (example: Projects/hello)
2. Copy your choice of make-xxxyyy makefile(s) (example: Projects/hello/make-gcc295 to use GCC 2.95.3)
3. Type "make -f make-xxxyyy" or read make-xxxyyy file for further Compile instructions (example: make -f make-gcc346)
