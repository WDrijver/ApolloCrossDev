Description
-----------

  This package contains a lib directory with several versions. Copy
the desired version to your LIBS: directory and rename it to "mpega.library".
  * WARNING * FPU versions of these libraries are slower than others, but they
are more accurate. FPU versions can be used to convert MPEGA Audio file to
pcm files with maximum quality. Integer versions (without 'FPU' in the library
name) are very fast and provide very good quality (very near to FPU version).

  In order to install the PPC version, you must copy mpegaPPC.library to LIBS:
  and rename it to mpega.library, then copy mpegappcXXX_library.elf to LIBS:
  (XXX is either FPU or INT, depending on the version you want).
  V2.1 need absolutly ppc.library from Phase 5 to work.

  The developer directory contains includes for SAS/C like compiler. For other
compilers, you can use the .fd file to build your programming interface.

  You can also find a short example to see how to use this library in the
developer/demo directory.


  Enjoy it !
